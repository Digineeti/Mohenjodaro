Indra[0,Agni[0]] : Are you sure we're in right place?
Indra[0,Agni[0]] : It looks like bunch of weaklings not even good for proper fight.
Jata Agni[0,Indra[0]] : Yes...yes...we're in right place.
Jata Agni[0,Indra[0]] : We've scouted and searched this entire area and this is the only logical place for bandits to hide.
Krav Agni[0,Indra[0]] : However, I am convinced that the other place had stronger fighters and more gold.
Krav Agni[0,Indra[0]] : Now I am stuck here with bunch of wimps and this good for nothing hotheaded brute.
Krav Agni[0,Indra[0]] : We could've easily defeated them and kept all the gold for ourselves.
Indra[0,Agni[0]] : Agni, are you talking to yourself agian?
Jata Agni[0,Indra[0]] : Ya, after a accident it felt I was divided into two people.
Jata Agni[0,Indra[0]] : One is me that is calm and logical and other.....
Krav Agni[0,Indra[0]] : I can be too be calm and logical, mamma's boy.
Jata Agni[0,Indra[0]] : can be bit more aggressive.
Indra[0,Agni[0]] : ( It's like talking to a lunatic but he is crazy strong.)
Indra[0,Agni[0]] : Alright let's round them up and get that gold.

Indra[0,Agni[0]] : How can you shoot fire from your hand?
Jata Agni[0,Indra[0]] : Don't know, since birth I guess.
Jata Agni[0,Indra[0]] : Look at these scars, I got them from these flames when I couldn't control them and from then on.....
Krav Agni[0,Indra[0]] : We're born hurling fire bolts everywhere.
Krav Agni[0,indra[0]] : I see you too have special ability of your own.
Indra[0,Agni[0]] : Ya, I can control lightening. Some say it is meant for great thing.
Indra[0,Agni[0]] : But all I want to be is rich and fat.
Indra[0,Agni[0]] : Let's search this area and look for their leader and loot.
Jata Agni[0,Indra[0]] : They were pretty easy but they got decient armour and weapons.
Krav Agni[0,Indra[0]] : Lets take them?

Indra[0,Agni[0]] : Hey, tell me where is your boss hiding.
Bandit : I...I do not know. He has a secrect room in this cave somewhere. He usually stays there and comes out only to raid the villages.
Bandit : There are three switches proctected by his lieutenants. Maybe thats how he gets in and out.
Indra : Thanks for the information. Time to sleep. Nighty- Night.
